This project has the purpose of moving the solar panel in the right position in order to get the maximum solar radiation from the sun and to produce electrical energy as much possible. It is built on Arduino MEGA R3 development board wich is based on ATMWGA2560 microcontroller.
The main feature of this project is the Bluetooth communication with a Android app to send data from sensors in real time and to get commands for solar tracker position.
It have sensors for temperature, humidity, voltage and current. The bluetooth module is HC-05.
